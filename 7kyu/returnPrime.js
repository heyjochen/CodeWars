/*
Output prime numbers
An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.

P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

//P: number
//R: prime numbers from 2 to n in an arr
//E: For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
//P: for loop from 2 to <n, empty array, if n % i !== 0 then push into array

// Need nested loop


function primes(n){
    let primes = []
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++){
        if (n % i !== 0) {
            primes.push(i)
        }
    }
    return primes
