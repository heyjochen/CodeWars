## My process

### Built with

- Javascript


### What I learned

The fizzbuzz challenge can be simplified by checking for 
```js
(i % 15 === 0) instead of (i % 15 === && i % 3 === 0)
```

<!-- 
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->
